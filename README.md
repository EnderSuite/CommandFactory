# CommandFactory

**The nice way to handle commands!**

---

The CommandFactory library increases your productivity whilst writing command logic for your plugin 
by a WHOLE lot! It creates an Object Oriented interface which makes creating many commands easy & tidy.

At the same time, it abstracts the given arguments by applying a "Regex a-like" pattern matcher, 
to extract required and optional arguments.
